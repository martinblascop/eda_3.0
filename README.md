The game consists of thinking a four digit number without repeating its digits (like '2837' or '6859'). The guesser tries to guess the number and the thinker tells the guesser how many digits are in the correct order and how many are not.
Ex:
Thinker: thinks 7284
Guesser: 7569
Thinker: 1G (because the digit 7 is in the correct order)
Guesser: 4258
Thinker: 1G 2R (because the digit 2 is in the correct order and the digits 4 and 8 are in the thinker's number but not in the correct order)
Guesser: 7284 
Thinker: 4G!! You won! (because all digits are in the correct order)
